# Keystone Eyrie Modular Runtime

Eyrie only builds as part of the Keystone [sdk](https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keystone-sdk).

We strongly encourage using the top-level [Keystone](https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keystone) build process.

# Build options

See the sdk Makefile for feature selection.
